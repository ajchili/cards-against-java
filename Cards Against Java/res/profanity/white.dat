Cold pizza
Friends reruns all day long
Awkward silences at dinner with the in-laws
A doorway to Narnia
A girls-night-out with my mother-in-law
My daughter and her friends having an earsplitting karaoke night
Speaking in the third person
Patting my head and rubbing my stomach at the exact same time.
A child prodigy
Useless celebrity facts
The Land Before Time XVII
Meat served on sticks
Having Mariah Carey stuck in my head for several hours straight
Overly dramatic eye-rolling
The Electric slide
Pulling limbs off Barbie Dolls
A lost Shakespearean play
A Boy Scouts’ camping trip gone wrong
Sleep talking
My mom’s minivan
Overwhelming enthusiasm
My junior high diary
An impulsive need to avoid stepping on cracks at all costs
Oversized earlobes
My family
Macaroni and cheese
A breath of fresh air
Giggling in inappropriate situations
When I picked my nose as an adult
The Disneyland parade
A poor British accent
Saturday morning cartoons
Caroline Bingley
A hidden agenda
The creepy Care Bear stare
